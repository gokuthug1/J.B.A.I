# J.B.A.I

J.B.A.I is an experimental chatbot inspired by ChatGPT. **Note:** This isn’t a full-fledged LLM—it's a fun project I built for experimentation. I update it whenever I can, so stay tuned for new features!

## Features

### 🔹 Delete Messages
- **Desktop:** Delete messages by **Shift + Clicking** on them.
- **Mobile:** **Tap and hold** a message to see a confirmation prompt.

### 🔹 Music
J.B.A.I now supports music requests! Just ask for a song or some music, and J.B.A.I will prompt you to choose one. For now, the library is small (about 12 songs featuring my favorites), but I plan to expand it to include more popular tracks over time.

### 🔹 Settings
Customize your chatbot experience with the new settings options:

#### 🗣️ TTS (Text-to-Speech)
- Toggle the TTS feature **on/off** to have J.B.A.I read out responses.

#### 🎙️ Change J.B.A.I's Voice
- Select a different voice for J.B.A.I using the **"Bot Voice"** dropdown menu in the settings.

#### 🔊 Adjust J.B.A.I's Volume
- Control the loudness of J.B.A.I's TTS with the **"Voice Volume"** slider in settings.
