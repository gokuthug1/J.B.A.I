## Features

### 🔹 Delete Messages
You can delete messages by clicking **Shift + Click** (Mouse Click). On mobile, simply **tap and hold** a message, and a confirmation prompt will appear.

### 🔹 Settings
I've recently added some settings to enhance the experience:

#### 1. 🗣️ TTS (Text-to-Speech)
- The TTS feature can be toggled **on/off** in the settings.
- When enabled, you can hear J.B.A.I instead of reading responses.

#### 2. 🎙️ Change J.B.A.I's Voice
- In the settings, there is an option labeled **"Bot Voice"**.
- You can change J.B.A.I’s voice using the dropdown menu next to it.

#### 3. 🔊 Adjust J.B.A.I's Volume
- In settings, find the **"Voice Volume"** option.
- This lets you adjust the TTS volume to control how loud J.B.A.I sounds.
