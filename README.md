# J.B.A.I

This is J.B.A.I. I'll update this whenever I have time, but just to be clear—this isn't a real LLM. I just made something similar to ChatGPT lol.

Go try it out lol, it's so bad: 🔽

## Features

### 🔹 Delete Messages
You can delete messages by clicking **Shift + Click** (Mouse Click). On mobile, simply **tap and hold** a message, and a confirmation prompt will appear.

### 🔹 Music!
I have now added music to the bot! Just ask J.B.A.I for a song or music and it will ask you what song. Keep in mind, I am one person and cannot add all the songs i nthe world bur for now, there are 12 I think and those are the songs I listen to so it will take time for me to at least have every popular song here.

### 🔹 Settings
I've recently added some settings to give it a chatbot UI look (I need improvement lol):

#### 1. 🗣️ TTS (Text-to-Speech)
- The TTS feature can be toggled **on/off** in the settings.
- When enabled, you can hear J.B.A.I instead of reading responses.

#### 2. 🎙️ Change J.B.A.I's Voice
- In the settings, there is an option labeled **"Bot Voice"**.
- You can change J.B.A.I’s voice using the dropdown menu next to it.

#### 3. 🔊 Adjust J.B.A.I's Volume
- In settings, find the **"Voice Volume"** option.
- This lets you adjust the TTS volume to control how loud J.B.A.I sounds.

Stay tuned for more updates!
